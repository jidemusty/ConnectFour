      <h3>Connect Four Game</h3>
      <p class="game_description">
        Connect Four is a game where players take turn dropping colored <br/>
        circles in the top of the board, along different rows.  <br/>
        The goal is to make a row of 4 circles in a row - straight or diagnal.
      </p>

      <div id="gameboard">
        <!-- 
          The game table is the actual board.  A table seems the most logical 
          structure for the data, as tables have rows and columns although you 
          most certainly could use divs, or other HTML elements.  The top row 
          (and tablehead - 'thead') is reserved for the buttons to drop the 
          game pieces.

                This could be programmatically generated like the rows/columns 
                below, but since it was just 7, it wouldn't really save code

              running a set of code multiple times.  It has 3 parameters, the first 
              is a variable name, in this case I used "row" and "col" I then set the 
              value to 0.  The next parameter is 'under what conditions should 
              i repeat the code below. As long as that 2nd condition is "true" 
              the code below will run. The last parameter is the increment.  
              This is run every time the code below is run.  In the loops below, 
              I have i++ and j++ which means "add one to the value of row/col"
